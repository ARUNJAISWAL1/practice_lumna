Go to CDN JS for getting the lightbox CSS and JS link to embed in your HTML file

Also, search for jQuery as jQuery is also a dependency.

Now go to the images in your HTML and add

data-lightbox = "image-1"
data-title = "Image-1"

In short, data-lightbox activates the lightbox and groups images into a gallery, while data-title adds a descriptive caption.
